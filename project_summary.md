## Description
This installation proposes a game between the book - "Cubo de Papel‚Äù - (Paper Cube) and the technological devices that transform our comprehension of information, the information exchange and the relationship among the means, the message and the beholder, so to speak: culture. With the electronic and digital technology emerging, other ways of world comprehension are being activated, therefore, the relationship between reading and writing is being given different alternatives for interpretation, which allow an enlargement of our perception field. 

This installation proposal starts being differentiated from the book - "Cubo de Papel" - by being amplified to the motion image field, interaction, interface desigh and electronics.
 
This proposal is the chapter 3 from a book, expanded to the environment and interaction. This book has been made 5 chapters so far, all of them underconstrution, which will appear in future posts as previous facts to this project.

## Description of the use and performance of the beholder:

It is a physical book - "Cubo de Papel" - that will have a video camera inside, which will capture the beholders' physical features. It will also have a mechanical structure that will control the horizontal movement of the book on a rail, from left to right and the other way around.

Along with this book, there will be a video-projection of multiple overlapped faces.
This projection will show images of faces that would have been already captured in real time with the video camera from the inside of the book.

Regarding the book horizontal motion, this will be actvated by a programming code, able to detect faces. It has features able to distinguish certain color and shape patterns on the beholders, which will be systematized and stored in a base data that allows the construction of a unique and estandarized face. If the beholder does not have these physical features, the book performs a movement away from the beholder, so it constructs a conexion of clasification and order, which is indicated by a computer pattern that will react in front of the beholder, whether be it rejection, acceptance, reaction, interaction, classification, file, print, trace, writing, dialogue, among other concepts that may generate a direct link between the beholder's body and the device, in this case, the paper cube.
